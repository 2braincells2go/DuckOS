<h1 align="center">What Is DuckOS?</h1>
<h5 align="center">An Operating System. A Internet Proxy. A tool used by students. And more! We focus mainly on exploiting Chromebooks‚Ñ¢ and putting a stop to internet censorship once and for all.

<h2 align="center">Blocked? It's alright! Host DuckOS by yourself.</h2>
<h5 align="center">Alright! Let's start with explaining how school filters work (Most of them)<br>Most filters are either on the wifi router or a chrome extension, like iBoss, Securely, and GoGuardian. They auto-block sites by looking up the website's keywords, description, title and their domains in general for blacklisted words, and sometimes if you get caught on a site by a teacher the teacher, hypothetically, can report the site to the filter they use, to get it blocked. In that case, you would need a new domain.<br>So now that you understand, let's get on to the hosting part. You can host with multiple services: Repl, Glitch, Github, or any other static site hosting services that's unblocked by your school. It's very easy, you probably won't even need a guide but if you do, I'll put buttons and instructions down below.</h5>
