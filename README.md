<p align="center">Introducing DuckOS: the world's first web-based operating system crafted purely with HTML, CSS, and JS. It offers an exceptional interface, top-notch apps, and an unmatched user experience. This enhanced version of DuckOS is dedicated to overcoming internet censorship, equipped with advanced proxies, popular games, and more. Embrace the future of web-based operating systems with DuckOS.</p>

<h2 align="center">DuckOS in the future üïí</h2>
<p align="center">What will DuckOS be like in the future? Nobody knows. But here's some things that I'm planning to add to DuckOS when I have more time:</p><br>
<p align="center">‚Ä¢ An app menu, allowing user to remove/add apps to taskbar</p>
<p align="center">‚Ä¢ Proxy Backend & Free Kasm!</p>
<p align="center">‚Ä¢ An more! You can view DuckOS v5's developement on Projects page</p>

<h2 align="center">Deploying DuckOS üöÄ</h2>
<p align="center">The world's leading web-based operating system remains unblocked by any hosting services to date! You have the opportunity to host DuckOS independently by forking this repository on Repl.it <a href="https://replit.com/github/GikitSRC/DuckOS-V5">here!</a><br>In the near future, DuckOS will integrate a proxy directly into its system, eliminating the need for iFrame elements. Unfortunately, this means that hosting DuckOS independently will no longer be possible üòî</p>
