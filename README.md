<h1 align="center">What Is DuckOS?</h1>

<h5 align="center">DuckOS is an operating system, an internet proxy, a tool used by students, and more! Our main focus is on exploiting Chromebooksâ„¢ and putting a stop to internet censorship once and for all. With DuckOS, you can use your computer without any restrictions or limits, thanks to our (probably) fastest internet proxy, Rammerhead, and the (based on opinion) best games you can play on the internet right now. (Sneak peak: Minecraft!) Start your uncensored internet journey with DuckOS today, whether you choose to support us with a paid or free version. ðŸ¦†</h5>

<h2 align="center">Blocked? It's All Right! Host DuckOS by Yourself.</h2>

<h5 align="center">Let's start by explaining how most school filters work. Most filters are either on the Wi-Fi router or a Chrome extension, like iBoss, Securely, and GoGuardian. They automatically block sites by searching for blacklisted keywords, descriptions, titles, and domains in general. Sometimes, if you get caught on a site by a teacher, they can report the site to the filter they use to get it blocked. In that case, you would need a new domain.

Now that you understand how it works, let's move on to hosting. You can host with multiple services, such as Repl, Glitch, Github, or any other static site hosting services that are unblocked by your school. It's very easy, and you probably won't even need a guide, but if you do, we'll provide buttons and instructions below.</h5>

<h5 align="center">This Project is now discontinued. We (ok fine i have been but i need people to help me) have been rewriting DuckOS, making it look way better, fixing bugs, just making everything better in general. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/GikitSRC/DuckOS-v5">DuckOS v5</a> for more updates! </h5>
